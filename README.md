# news-socialmedia

Site to aggregate news media articles from different news sites along with relevant twitter discussions and display them on a location aware basis

Used Webhose API to collect news and Google and Twitter API to geocode and collect tweets respectively. I've cloned the repo from [dvarik/news-socialmedia](https://github.com/dvarik/news-socialmedia) (Hey Dan!) who was a contributor to this project so that I can make additional changes without busting the original project.

To run this project:

+ Install node.js
+ Ensure that you have all the dependencies in node-modules installed
+ Run server.js
+ open the website on //localhost:8080
